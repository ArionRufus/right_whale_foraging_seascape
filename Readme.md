This github project brings together all the code and some of the data used
for the publication "Diving into whalesâ€™ foraging seascapes: how currents and 
prey depth distribution shape right whale feeding grounds".
<br/>
The github is split into 3 folders, and each link below leads you one of these 
folder which comes with an explanation file like this one. 
<br/>
<br/>

## 1- Depth distribution
[This folder](https://github.com/ArionRufus/right_whale_foraging_seascape/blob/master/1_depth_distribution/depth_distribution.md) describes the code and data used to set up the model changing 
particles depth distribution over time, by simulating distributions that fit 
with a dataset of many depth distribution profiles. 


## 2- MINDZ
[This folder](https://github.com/ArionRufus/right_whale_foraging_seascape/blob/master/2_MINDZ/MINDZ.md) describes the code and data of the model *MINDZ* with *CIOPS-E* forcings. 
The model *MINDZ* uses currents forcings to simulate particles trajectories. 
This version also integrates the depth distribution model. Finally, it also 
includes R codes aiming at changing the outputs of MINDZ into 2D density data.


## 3- Results visualisation
[This folder](https://github.com/ArionRufus/right_whale_foraging_seascape/blob/master/3_Results_visualisation/visu.md) describes the code used to create maps and graphics from aggregation data.
