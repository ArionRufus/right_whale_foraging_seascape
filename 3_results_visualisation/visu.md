## 3- Results visualisation describes the code used to create maps and graphics from aggregation data.  The data comes partly from the second part of the repository.
<br/>
<br/>
It also comes from several plane surveys. 
<br/>
<br/>
The R code *1_correlation* Shape the data from plane surveys into 1 dataset, and explore the correlations between whales presence and absence and the simulated aggregation areas.  
<br/>
<br/>
The R code *2_mean_map* creates maps of right whales distribution, daily aggregation areas, average aggregation areas, and standard deviation of aggregation values.
